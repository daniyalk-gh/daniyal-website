        Hello! I’m <strong>Daniyal Khan</strong>, currently a student at <strong>Emory University</strong>.
        I’ve always been fascinated by Tech and Mathematics.
        This page is a glimpse into my journey — how I got here, and what drives me forward.

      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Slough, a small town west of London, England.

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>
        I completed my A-levels in Maths, Physics, and Chemistry, achieving A*A*A
        respectively, giving me a strong foundation in analytical thinking.
        Now at Emory University, I’m pursuing Computer Science and exploring areas such as
        Economics and Data Science.

      <h2>Beyond Academics</h2>
      <p>
        Outside the classroom, I enjoy playing badminton and table tennis, exploring new
        cities, and learning languages. I also value community — from joining campus clubs
        to meeting people with different perspectives.
